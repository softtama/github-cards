# Unofficial GitHub Cards

Forked from [lepture/github-cards](https://github.com/lepture/github-cards) and originally modified just for my personal use.


## New feature: Show user bio

For user card, now you are able to show your GitHub profile bio by setting parameter `data-show-bio`.

```html
<div class="github-card" data-user="softtama" data-show-bio></div>
```

<br>Avaliable for both Default and Medium theme.

**Default**<br>

**Medium**<br>

## Usage

I'm not hosting this anywhere else. If you want to use it, just use rawgit.com and use the generated CDN link.

Complete instructions, **read the original readme**.


## Notice

I'm not maintaining this modified forked project anymore (except if I found something serious later), since it worked flawlessly on my personal use (I used it on my blog). So I will likely **ignore all bug reports**.
